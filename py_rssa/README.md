# py_rssa

This project provides a lightweight Python port of the `rssa` package.
Alongside the original one-dimensional routines it now includes:

* ``cssa`` for complex valued series.
* ``NDSSA``/``ndssa`` supporting arbitrary dimensional data and shaped
  window masks.
* Pure Python Hankel helpers and utilities such as ``wcor`` and ``wnorm``.
